In post details how focal loss can be used for a multi class classification LightGBM model.

By using Focal Loss, sample weight balancing, or artificial addition of new samples to reduce the imbalance are not required. 
On an artificially generated multi-class imbalanced dataset, the use of Focal loss increased the recall value and eliminated some of the false positives and negatives in the minority classes.
